HELLO! WELCOME TO THE PERIMETER AND AREA APP.

Are you tired of of calculating the perimeter using your head and calculator?

Well, lucky for there's a solution...HERE IS THE PERIMETER AND AREA CALCULATOR.

which allows you to find the perimeter or area of a shape with ease, thanks to the rogram created to enables this, now you can.

For Example:

"I want to find the perimeter of a Square, with the sides measuring = 5 cm"
No problem!

This is simple, we all know that the formula of the perimeter of a square is = 4 x side or 4 * side

So, simply input a number in the input box and press the calculate button and the answer will display.

Also, now you can enter a integer, negative integers and a number with decimals.

If you do not enter anything, the message will display "Input cannot be empty"

AND

If you do not enter a number, you enter a letter or punctuation marks, the message will display "Please enter a valid number"

For Example (Area):

"I want to find the area of a triangle, with the sides measuring = length == 7 cm, width == 5 cm, height == 4 cm"
No problem!

This is simple, we all know that the formula of the area of a triangle is = 0.5 or 1/2 ((base = length * width) * height

So, simply input a number in the input box and press the calculate button and the answer will display.



So, that is about all of it, you will enjoy this app and let me know what changes I can make.

GOODBYE, LADIES AND FELLAS!



N.B Unfortunately for school students ranging from any grade in primary and high school and university included, since this app is on your devices you will not be able use it when writing exams cuz you will get caught by
the invilators of the math exam you write and not pass. SO, do not attempt to use this app when writing exams.

HOWEVER! Good news is you can use this app as a study tool when studying area and perimeter.
